details: The simplecochlea package was developped during the M4 ERC project, which investigated how the human brain learns and recognises visual and auditory stimuli. It is a basic cochlea model, converting an input sound into neural spikes. Later on, a Spike Timing Dependend Plasticity algorithm was used to learn in a unsupervised way repeating patterns in the input sound.
