details: micMac was designed in the context of the EpiFaR project, to examine EEG/iEEG recordings in a simple and intuitive way. The first goal was to assist in the research of high frequency oscillations in intracerebral recording with both macro and micro contacts. It allows visualization in time, frequency or time frequency domains of multi-channels data and includes automatic detectors for certain epileptic events.
