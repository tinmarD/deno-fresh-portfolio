details: pySAB was designed to analyse EEG recordings during the SAB experiment, where a participant tries to recognise previously seen images. The pySAB package include pre-processing steps, ERP analysis and decoding algorithms using SVMs. It helped in the investigation of the dynamics of the visual recognition as well as regions involved in the process.
